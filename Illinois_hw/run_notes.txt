Run 2 Changes
 -- Using DDQN
 -- Introduced random actions between lives in both replay buffer and training
 -- Prefilled replay buffer with 100K steps of Run 1 Serial using epsilon=0.2, sticky action prob = 0.2
 -- Memory Capacity reduced from 1M to 300K
 -- Sticky Action prob = 0.2
 -- Implemented adaptive training frequency
 
 Run 3 Changes
 -- logarithimic decay epsilong (rate = .000015)
 -- LR scheduler step size 50K (from 100K) and gamma=0.5 (from 0.4)
 NOTE: changed score moving average for graph to 50 episodes
 
 Run 4 Changes
 -- start from naive agent, start training after 20K frames
 -- replay buffer size of 200K
 -- recursive eponential epsilon decay (.998 rate)
 -- epislon bump on reward stall
 -- fixed history reset and env randomization after lost lives
 -- removed adaptive training frequency.  Now locked at every 4 frames
 -- update_target_network_frequency increased to 3000, so given training every 4 frames, actual update frequency is every 12K frames
 
 Run 5 Changes
 -- modified epsilon bump as follows:
	plateau_patience = 200 # was 100
	epsilon_bump = 0.15  # was .1
	soonest_bump = 600  # didn't exist	
	

Run 6 (DQN)
- standardize at 350K training frames for comparison purposes
- generally try to match hyperparams from DQN and DDQN papers
- pre-seeded replay buffer with 50K frames from best peforming Run5 model
- lower batch size to 64
- train every frame
- update target frequency to 10K
- removed sticky actions
- Epsilon min 0.1.  Epsilon -= (self.epsilon - self.epsilon_min) / 500K

Run 7 (DQN)
-- Same as run 6 but with 750K frames


Run 11 (DDQN)
-- pre-seeded replay buffer with 50K frames from best peforming Run5 model
-- 1M steps
-- Epsilon min 0.1.  Epsilon -= (self.epsilon - self.epsilon_min) / 750K
-- Epsilon bump of .15 if 300 eps no improvement (after ep 2000 only)
-- Mem Capacity 750K
-- batch_size = 64 #Originally 128
-- scheduler_gamma = 0.65
-- scheduler_step_size = 100_000  #orignally 100_000
-- update_target_network_frequency = 10_000


Runs 12 and 13
--750K training frames each
-- Run 12 is DDQN, 13 is DQN
-- Using fixed mini batch sampling logic
-- Other hyperparams:	
	EXPLORE_STEPS = 500_000 #orignally 500000, lowered because only training every 4th step
	EPSILON_MIN = 0.1
	train_frame = 50_000 #Originally 100000.  Lower to speed up testing during debugging
	sticky_action_prob = 0.0
	learning_rate = 0.0001
	evaluation_reward_length = 50  #changed from 100
	Memory_capacity = 750_000 #Originally 1000000
	BATCH_SIZE = 64 #Originally 128
	scheduler_gamma = 0.65
	scheduler_step_size = 100_000  #orignally 100_000


 
 Future Improvements:
-- LTSM
-- modifying NN to include temporal differencing frames as inputs
-- prioritized replay experience

Non Improvement TODOs:
-- Implement model tester (run X rounds, compute avg score)
-- If time, implement PPO SB3 and compare to my DQN model
